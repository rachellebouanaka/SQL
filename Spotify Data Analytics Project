# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the 10 most popular tracks, listing the artist and the name of their track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIt 10; 

#Then I found the average popularity score of all the tracks
SELECT AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Next, I found the energy of the 10 least popular songs
SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 10;

#Lastly, I listed all the artists and track names with popularity scores '90, 91, and 92'.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE popularity IN (90, 91, 92);
